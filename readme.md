ChronoKey is not another timeline presenter.
It´s made with [electron](https://www.electronjs.org "electronjs home"), [TimeLineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com "knight lab home") and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap 5 home").

It needs a lot of improvements but it´s usable right now
